**Exercise 1: Code and Functions Generation**

*Objective*: Generate snippets of code using Codeium as AI-assistant

*Instructions:*
Using Codeium as AI-assistant:
- Read a datafile into a Pandas `DataFrame` object, produce datafile descriptives and plot the data distributions.
    - Write a function that takes as input a `DataFrame` and that calculates basic descriptive statistics like: number of rows (`nrow`), number of columns (`ncol`), data types of each column, basic summary statistics (like mean, min, max for numeric columns).
    - Write a function that takes as inputs a `DataFrame` and a column and generate an histogram to visualize data distribution if the column is numeric (e.g., `int64`, `float64`), a bar plot showing the category frequency if the column is categorical. 
- Review the AI-generated code and compare it to the version you would have written independently without the AI-assistant.
