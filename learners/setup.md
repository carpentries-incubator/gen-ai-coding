title: Setup
---

For this lesson, the setup includes a coding environment, an AI coding assistant, and datasets for practical exercises.

## Code Editor

The recommended code editor for this lesson is Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor frequently used by researchers. You can download it from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow the instructions on the website to install it on your operating system.

## Setting up Codeium

1. Make sure you have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed on your computer. Go to [the Codeium download page](https://codeium.com/download) to see a list of supported IDEs and installation instructions. Visual Studio Code is on the list, so if you followed the previous step, you are all set.

2. Open Extension Marketplace: Open the Extension Marketplace, which is the icon with boxes on the primary sidebar in your VS Code.

3. Install Codeium: Type Codeium in the marketplace search bar, open up the page and click the blue Install button.

4. Authorize: After installation is complete, you should be prompted by Visual Studio Code with a pop-up on the bottom right to authorize Codeium. 
*If not, you should see an option to sign in to your Codeium account in the bottom left Accounts tab of your Visual Studio Code window.* 
Click the Sign in with Auth to use Codeium option. Either method (popup or Accounts tab) should redirect you to the Codeium website.

5. Create Account: If you do not have a Codeium account yet, you will be redirected to create an account.

6. Sign In: If you are not signed in, please sign in with your account details. Once you sign in, you will be redirected back to Visual Studio Code via pop-up.
Click Open Visual Studio Code, which should redirect you back to Visual Studio Code.
*If you are using a browser-based IDE, instead of being redirected back with pop-up, you will be routed to instructions on how to complete authentication by providing an access token. Please follow these instructions instead of Step 6, and then continue on with "Using Codeium."*

7. All Done! You will be asked to confirm the authentication in Visual Studio Code (click Open in the resulting pop-up).

You can alternatively follow the [Codeium installation instructions in VS Code](https://codeium.com/vscode_tutorial) on the official website, which will guide you through the same steps.

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `spoiler`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
