# AI-assisted Coding with Codeium

<!-- BADGES
It is customary to add "badges" to the top of your README. These might include:
* A badge for your lesson DOI. If you have published on Zenodo, the Markdown source for this badge is available in the sidebar of the relevant Zenodo entry.
* A badge indicating the status of any important workflows running on your repository, e.g. the lesson build workflow. This will help visitors quickly see the health of the current version of the repository.

This interactive workshop “AI-assisted Coding with Codeium” is designed for researchers who want to optimize their coding workflow using AI tools. Whether you are new to coding or experienced, this class will guide you through practical techniques to improve your coding experience. You will learn how to configure and use AI coding assistants to generate, refactor, and improve code, automate repetitive tasks, and improve documentation. Essential topics such as debugging with AI assistance and managing ethical and security considerations in AI-powered coding environments will also be covered.

This hands-on session is perfect for anyone who wants to simplify their coding process, save time, and write cleaner, more efficient code. By the end, you will have the skills you need to integrate AI into your coding practice with confidence. Basic programming knowledge and experience with a code editor such as VS Code are recommended.
